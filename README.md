##What is this?
This is a collection of sketch ideas for improving Orbot status information for users.

The main screen sketches are really basic at the moment.

I'll be making sketches covering the following statuses:

1. Orbot is working and connected (to the Tor network and therefore you have Internet connection). [Sketches available)(https://github.com/ei8fdb/orbot-status-ui/blob/master/orbot-status-connected-options-v1.pdf)

2. Orbot is not working because you do not have Internet connection.

3. Orbot (is connected to the Internet but) is not connected (to the Tor network).

4. Bork!! Bork!! Restart Orbot because we don't know whats happened!

There is another status that I amn not sure of yet - Orbot is not connected to the Tor network because the Tor network might be blocked.
